# Overview

As a software engineer I have learned problem solving skills and syntax rules that I can apply when learning new languages and frameworks. I have spent a couple of weeks trying to learn how to make a web application using Django and Python.

I have created a web application that displays "Hello World". 
My goal was to have a recipe app that could add and remove recipes and images. I ran into a few problems that slowed down my process but I am really excited about this project idea so I am going to keep trying and update this repository as soon as I get the code running properly

The purpose of writing this was to learn how to use Django and Python together.


# Web Pages

As of right now it is just "Hello World"

# Development Environment
* Django
* Python 3.10.0
* Visual Studio Code

# Useful Websites

* [O'Reilly - Django 3 - Full Stack Websites with Python Web Development](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/django-3/9781801818148/)
* [Sitepoint - PYTHON WEB DEVELOPMENT WITH DJANGO AND FLASK: GETTING STARTED](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/python-web-development-with-django-and-flask-getting-started/read/1/)

# Future Work

* Add and delete recipes 
* Have a login so different people can log in and use the app
* database that stores recipes
